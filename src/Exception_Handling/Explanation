                                                   Exception in JAVA

  *exception is an event that occurs during time of execution of program and interrupts the normal flow of execution of
   program....

  *exception can be occurred due to three types of errors:-
  (i)Syntax error
  (ii)Logical error
  (iii)Runtime error

  **Exception Handling is method to handle the run time exception occurred during execution of program such as
   ArrayIndexOutOfBound,FileNotFound,Arithmetic,SQLExceptions etc......

  types of Exception:-

  1. Checked Exceptions
  Checked exceptions are the exceptions that are checked at compile-time.
  This means that the compiler verifies that thecode handles these exceptions either by catching them or declaring them
  in the method signature using the throws keyword.

  **IOException:An exception is thrown when an input/output operation fails,such as when reading from or writing to a file.

  **SQLException: It is thrown when an error occurs while accessing a database.

  **ParseException: Indicates a problem while parsing a string into another data type, such as parsing a date.

  **ClassNotFoundException: It is thrown when an application tries to load a class through its string name using methods
    like Class.forName(), but the class with the specified name cannot be found in the classpath.


  2. Unchecked Exceptions (Runtime Exceptions)
  Unchecked exceptions, also known as runtime exceptions, are not checked at compile-time.
  These exceptions usually occur due to programming errors, such as logic errors or incorrect assumptions in the code.

 ** NullPointerException: It is thrown when trying to access or call a method on an object reference that is null.

 ** ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: It occurs when we try to access an array element with an invalid index.

 ** ArithmeticException: It is thrown when an arithmetic operation fails, such as division by zero.
