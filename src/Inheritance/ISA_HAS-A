Inheritance is known as ISA relationship.
:its also called as blood relation where one class access all the properties and methods of another class.
:classes are tightly coupled
:extend keyword is used
advantages of inheritance is---
1)code reusability
2)cost cutting
3)reduce redundancy
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HAS_A relation is known as association relation.
:it can be achieved using new keyword
:creating object of one class as an member of another class
:extend keyword is not used
:all the properties are not extended
:classes are not tightly coupled

types of association:-
1)aggregation
2)composition

# Aggregation has a weak bonding between two classes
for example car class and music player classes has HAS-a relation but both are independent without each other
both the classes are loosely coupled

# Composition= strong bonding between two classes in known as composition
for example car class and engine class has HAS-A relation and are dependent one each other
both the classes are tightly coupled

Example------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
package Myjava;

public class Has_A_Example {
    Single_inheritance x=new Single_inheritance();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Has_A_Example n=new Has_A_Example();
        int v=n.x.cube(2);
        System.out.println(v);
    }
}
